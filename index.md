    <p>At Elevance Health, I have numerous tasks but in short, I solve problems others can't solve. One example of this involves ingestion of the Payer Transparency files. I helped to build a Kubernetes pipeline to download, unpack push these data files into Snowflake to make them actionable.</p>
    
    <p>At Presence Health, I worked on financial analyses using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Additionally, I use predictive models to save lives and dollars.</p>
    
    <p>Prior to Presence Health, I had various roles at UnitedHealthcare.</p>
    
    <p>When I'm not working I'm a parent for two wonderful boys, maintain a vegetable garden, always learning and always moving.</p>
